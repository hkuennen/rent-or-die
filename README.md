# Rent or Die

## Philosophy

This app was the first full-stack web application collaboratively developed by our team during the Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp. The idea was to create an Airbnb-style platform but with a unique twist: instead of renting apartments, users would rent something entirely different.

In our case, we chose to rent out Survivalists in a post-apocalyptic world. These survival experts help ensure your chances of staying alive on a doomed planet. Without the guidance of specialized instructors, you will—just as the app's name suggests—die.

## Description

After logging in or signing up, you can browse the full list of available Survivalists. Each profile includes their location, so you can see whether they are near you.

Once you select a Survivalist, you can choose a date and time to arrange a meeting. Pricing is determined by skill level and duration, allowing you to decide how long you want to "book" their services.

Another key feature of the app is the ability to offer yourself as a specialist. If you have survival skills, you can list yourself as an expert, allowing others to book your services to help them navigate the post-apocalyptic world.
